	<h3>Bezier Splines: Part 1</h3>

	<p>
		Artists and designers often find it more convenient
		to create splines by moving points around, rather
		than needing to deal with derivatives.
		The <i>Bezier</i> spline enables designers
		of spline curves
		to work this way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bezier splines work by repeated linear interpolation.
		For example, the image to the right shows a simplified
		version of a Bezier spline, using three key points
		to specify a parametric quadratic spline.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that points along the curve are
		found as a linear interpolation of linear interpolations.
		We first find points along the edges AB and BC
		by linear interpolations (to get the points represented as red dots):
	</p>
	<p>
		<font color=red>(1 - t) A + t B</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		<font color=red>(1 - t) B + t C</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		and then we interpolate again (to get the point represented as a purple dot):
	</p>
	<p>
		<font color=#dd95b4>P = (1 - t) <font color=red>(( 1 - t) A + t B)</font> + t <font color=red>((1 - t) B + t C)</font></font>
	</p>
	<p>
		If we multiply out all the terms, we get:
	</p>
	<p>
		<font color=#dd95b4> A (1-t)<sup>2</sup> + 2 B (1-t) t + C t<sup>2</sup> </font>
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the weights of the coefficients (1 2 1) follow Pascal's triangle.
