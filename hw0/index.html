    <h3> Ahmet Ilten (netid: ai2068) </h3>
    <p> Hi, this page is for the Computer Graphics class at NYU. </p>

    <h4> Why am I taking this class? </h4>
    <p> My main motivation for taking this class is to gain a better understanding of how rendering and graphics work. This is very interesting to me becuase graphics allow us to create virtual worlds inside the computer and experience a different kind of reality, one that we can make the rules. That is also why I'm interested in games. </p> 
    <p> I have experience with third party game engines like Unity and Unreal but when it comes to rendering and graphics, they do the heavy lifting. While I'm grateful for the abstractions those engines provide so I can focus on other things, I think it's useful to understand how graphcis work on a fundemental level. I hope this will help me use game engines more effectively whether it's a commercial or a custom one. </p>
